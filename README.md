ðŸ…±ðŸ…»ðŸ…°ðŸ†€'s NLP Task Performer leverages the power of machine learning to offer a comprehensive suite of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. From sentiment analysis to named entity recognition (NER), this application provides an intuitive interface for performing a variety of NLP tasks on any input text.


### Introduction
This project utilizes the LLMWare suite to integrate various NLP models into a single, user-friendly Gradio interface. It aims to simplify complex NLP tasks, making them accessible to both technical and non-technical users alike.

### Features
```Sentiment Analysis```: Determine the sentiment expressed in the text.
```Emotion Detection```: Identify the emotions conveyed.
```Tag Generation```: Generate relevant tags for content categorization.
```Topic Identification```: Discover the main topics discussed.
```Intent Recognition```: Understand the intent behind the text.
```Rating Determination```: Assign ratings based on sentiment.
```Category Classification```: Classify text into predefined categories.
```Named Entity Recognition (NER)```: Identify and classify named entities.
```Natural Language Inference (NLI)```: Predict the logical relationship between sentences.
